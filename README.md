    - Tag filter. Dynamically update shown projects based on user filters.
        - Types of projects (e.g. Website, Game)
        - Coding languages (e.g. Javascript, C++)
        - Under Development
        - Checkbox. Starts unchecked to indicate all projects are shown. Checking the box will filter projects by only checked tags. E.g. Imagine a project with two tags, javascript and website. If the python tag is checked then the project will not show because it does not have the python tag. If the javascript tag is checked then the project will show even if the website tag is unchecked and the python tag is checked.
    - Cards must have a tag associated to:
        - Type of project 
        - Coding language 
        - Under Development
