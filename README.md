## To-Do
About Me Page:
    - Introduction
    - Career & Skills
    - Contact (LinkedIn)
    - Styling
Projects Page:
    - Styling
        - Make the Roblox logo more centered
        - Check if all screen sizes appropriately see project descriptions. Sometimes you can see the descriptions without hovering over the projects.
        - Look for high quality imgs
Resume Page:
    - Add a pdf of resume
Code Cleanup:
    - add "aria-labels" for accessability
    - Add correct tags to project data (coding language, project type, under development)
    - When switching to the "Projects" page. The page doesnt wait to load before showing things. This results in large icons and unformatted text appearing for a second.
Future Considerations:
    - Footer
    - Different layouts per screen size
        - desktop
        - laptop
        - mobile
